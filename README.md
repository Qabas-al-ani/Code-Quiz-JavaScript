# Code-Quiz-JavaScript: 

This is my Code-Quiz-JavaScript that I created by using the HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript.
I added a screenshot of the working Code-Quiz, and also i included a litle video that shows the functionality of the Code Quiz.

## Technologies: 

* HTML, I used the html to write the structure of my web page.
* Bootstrap, I used the Bootstrap to style my web page and give it some nice looking by adding colors.
* JavaScript to add the functionality to the Code Quiz JavaScript.

## Editors:

* [Microsoft VS CODE:](  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ ) it’s an awesome code editor.
* [Nodepad++]( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ ) it’s very helpful code editor that am using all the time plus it’s very light weight.
